# AQA-CompScience-Alevel-GradeBoundaryCalculator
A basic python program which allows you to calculate how many marks you need on the AQA A-level exam if you know your coursework mark (and vice versa) based on the 2019 Grade Boundaries. To use the program, simply choose and option an enter your corresponding mark. The program will then give you an estimation of the mark you need to get a certain grade based off of the 2019 AQA Computer Science A-level Grade Boundaries (see https://filestore.aqa.org.uk/over/stat_pdf/AQA-A-LEVEL-RL-GDE-BDY-JUN-2019.PDF). 
Originally the calculator was for personal use and made quickly so there are a couple of questionable coding styles littered throughout the program, but all together gets the job done - enjoy!
